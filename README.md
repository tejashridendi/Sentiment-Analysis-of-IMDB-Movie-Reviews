# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDB-Movie-Reviews
This project is a sentiment analysis model to classify a given review as positive or negative. Sentiment Analysis leverages both Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning skills - how to represent text in a machine-understandable format so as to classify the text and extract sentiment. We do visualizations and deploy models in the real world. 
Dataset:
The IMDb Movie Reviews dataset is available at this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meghjoshii/NSDC_DataScienceProjects_SentimentAnalysis/main/IMDB%20Dataset.csv'

Results:
**As it is a balanced dataset and also a classification task, we can use accuracy as metric for evaluation of performance of models on it. **

# MultinomialNaive Bayes has performed the best for this taskon this IMDB dataset of 50000 rows out of all the above models trained above and evaluated based on accuracy as measure of performance. 

The order of their performances in descendeing order is  as follows: 

MultinomialNaive Bayes: 74.25% 

Logistic Regression: 61.08%
